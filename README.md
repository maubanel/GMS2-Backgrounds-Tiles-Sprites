This tutorial is intended for those wanting an introducton to <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> using their sprite and tiling tools. It is a good idea to look at [Sprite Editor IDE Basics](https://marketplace.yoyogames.com/assets/4370/the-sprite-editor-ide-basics) but this walk through will be a bit more hands on.

This walkthrough also assumes you have access to Photoshop (or another pixel basee editor) though there are other free options out there for pixel editing.
		
This is a just a primer on creating art assets and not a detailed guide.  It is just to get you up and running in developing raster based 2-d assets.  We will end with creating controls for a playable sprite.
